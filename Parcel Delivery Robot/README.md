My version of the parcel delivery robot from chapter 7.  
It generates a random list of parcels for the robot to deliver.  Then the robot delivers them in an efficient manner based on the roads available as mapped.

The example robot in the book completed the route in an average of 16 turns, my robot completes the route in an average of 13 turns.
